Important Instructions for Robust Execution:

• Handle Obstacles Autonomously: During your search, handle common web automation challenges on your own. For example, if you encounter cookie consent banners, login prompts, or other pop-ups, accept or close them to proceed with the task.
• Manage Search Failures: If a specific search query yields no results, automatically move on to the next keyword or search strategy.
• Error Handling for Links: If you successfully find an RFP but cannot retrieve its specific Source Link (e.g., you encounter a blank link error or a broken redirect), do not stop the process. Simply leave the 'Source Link' cell for that particular entry blank in the final table and continue to the next RFP.
