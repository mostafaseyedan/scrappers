Search Scope & Filters

Core Workflow
Navigate to the All Bids list after logging in and accept any cookie or pop-up prompts.
For each keyword:
Use the search bar or scroll to locate relevant bids.
Apply any available filters for Active/Upcoming and USA.
Sort by closing date ascending, then iterate results.
For each listing, open the bid detail page. Capture the detail page URL as siteUrl.
Extract required fields from the detail page. Only process if closingDate is in the future.
Skip duplicates based on [title, issuer, closingDate].

Resilience & Error Handling
Dismiss cookie banners or pop-ups.
If a search yields no results, continue to next keyword.
Retry navigation or extraction up to 2 times for transient errors.
If any field is missing (except siteId, site, siteUrl, extractedDate) leave it blank.
